# Solana Twitter

## General Info

This is a modern verion of a popular [solana-twitter](https://lorisleiva.com/create-a-solana-dapp-from-scratch)
app, made in 2021 by **Loris Leiva**. For some reason, author
is no longer updates this series of articles, so it is now outdated.

So I did some work to bring the project back to life.
This work includes:

- migrating to newer / safer versions of libraries used
- minor bug and logic fixes
- updating code to latest version of Anchor (0.30 and newer).

Feel free to examine and learn something new. If this helps you, 
please don't forget to give me a star on GitHub.

*If you see any mistakes or errors - please open a PR.*

## Episodic Notes

### Episode 4

First of all, you can staight away change the `SendTweet` struct
to this:

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct SendTweet<'info> {
    #[account(init, payer = author, space = Tweet::LEN)]
    pub tweet: Account<'info, Tweet>,
    #[account(mut)]
    pub author: Signer<'info>,
    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

Using more specific fields will put more constraints and will be 
much better in terms of ergonomics than using Rust attributes.

If you're getting errors concerning **safety checks**, proceed to
[this](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/the-accounts-struct#safety-checks)
doc page.

When handling errors, use `err!()` macro instead of `Err(<>.into())`:

```diff
if topic.chars().count() > 50 {
    - return Err(ErrorCode::TopicTooLong.into())
    + return err!(ErrorCode::TopicTooLong);
}

if content.chars().count() > 280 {
    - return Err(ErrorCode::ContentTooLong.into())
    + return err!(ErrorCode::ContentTooLong);
}
```

### Episode 5

Make sure you don't use `@project-serum/anchor` library (which is
outdated), but `@coral-xyz/anchor` instead. If you don't - you will
stumble across millions of stupid warnings and errors.

When catching errors in the last few tests, use `error.error.errorMessage`
instead of `error.msg`, as it is outdated too.

### Episode 6

This note right in the beginning...:

> This applies for Apple M1 users that have to run 
solana-test-validator --no-bpf-jit --reset and anchor 
test --skip-local-validator instead of anchor test. 
Just make sure you restart your local ledger before 
running the tests every time.

...is in fact outdated.

The only true and unified way (as of now) to run the tests is using
`anchor test`. 

### Episode 7

This is where things are becoming shitty. I will note everything you
need step by step (using author's titles):

#### Install Vue CLI

Just use [official Vue installation manual](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html).

#### Create a new Vue app

Do as it is written in the original article.

#### Install Solana and Anchor libraries

**Again, you should install `@coral-xyz/anchor`, 
NOT `@project-serum/anchor`!**

```sh
npm install @solana/web3.js @project-serum/anchor
```

#### Configure node polyfills

Remove all code from `config.vue.js`. Insert this:

```js
const webpack = require('webpack')
const { defineConfig } = require('@vue/cli-service')

module.exports = defineConfig({
    transpileDependencies: true,
    configureWebpack: {
        plugins: [
            new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
                Buffer: ['buffer', 'Buffer']
            })
        ],
        resolve: {
            fallback: {
                crypto: false,
                fs: false,
                assert: false,
                process: false,
                util: false,
                path: false,
                stream: require.resolve('stream-browserify'),
                http: require.resolve('stream-http'),
                https: require.resolve('https-browserify'),
                zlib: require.resolve('browserify-zlib'),
                url: require.resolve('url/'),
            }
        }
    }
})
```

#### Configure ESLint

Do as it is.

#### Install TailwindCSS

Do as it is.

#### Install Vue Router

Do as it is.

#### Copy/paste some files

Do as it is to the end of the episode.

### Episode 8

In this episode, you should simply use `AnchorProvider` instead of
`Provider` object while initializing workspace:

```js
import { computed } from 'vue'
import { useAnchorWallet } from 'solana-wallets-vue'
import { Connection, PublicKey } from '@solana/web3.js'
import { AnchorProvider, Program } from '@project-serum/anchor'
import idl from '../../../target/idl/solana_twitter.json'

const programID = new PublicKey(idl.metadata.address)
let workspace = null

export const useWorkspace = () => workspace

export const initWorkspace = () => {
    const wallet = useAnchorWallet()
    const connection = new Connection('http://127.0.0.1:8899')
    const provider = computed(() => new AnchorProvider(connection, wallet.value))
    const program = computed(() => new Program(idl, programID, provider.value))

    workspace = {
        wallet,
        connection,
        provider,
        program,
    }
}
```

In fact, we should change something too in this piece of code later
(of course, if you want it to work ðŸ˜…). But I will leave this as it
is to the next episode note.

### Episode 9
Before you try to do something in this episode: **Don't forget to run 
`solana-test-validator` to start the local ledger and 
`anchor run test` to get access to the the tweets from the tests!**

Honestly, for me it was a challenge to get things done here. For
some reasons, I was constantly getting the exact same error:

```
index.js:5065 Uncaught (in promise) TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'size')
    at new AccountClient (index.js:5065:39)
    at eval (index.js:5030:30)
    at Array.reduce (<anonymous>)
    at AccountFactory.build (index.js:5029:70)
    at NamespaceFactory.build (index.js:6219:51)
    at new Program (index.js:6320:97)
    at eval (useWorkspace.js:16:1)
    at ReactiveEffect.eval [as fn] (reactivity.esm-bundler.js:987:44)
    at ReactiveEffect.run (reactivity.esm-bundler.js:238:19)
    at get value (reactivity.esm-bundler.js:994:147)
```

However, these are the changes to the original episode that will do
the job:

File: `useWorkspase.js`
```diff
- new Program(idl, programID, provider.value));
+ new Program(idl, provider.value));
```

As it turns out, the constructor of the `Program` class has changed,
but the contributors of Anchor didn't reflect that change in the
documentation (I didn't find any mention of this in the official
CHANGELOG either). And it is pretty logical action to do: 
since we pass in `idl`, why should we pass the field of `idl` as well?

The rest of the episode is pretty straightforward, although if you
will go by the author's order, you will first get an error when 
clicking on a timestamp link. But he handles it at the end of the
episode, so just follow him.
